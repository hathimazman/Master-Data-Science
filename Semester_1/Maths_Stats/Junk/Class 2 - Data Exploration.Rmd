# Exercise 3

Vicente et al. (2006) analysed data from observations of wild boar and red deer reared on a number of estates in Spain. The dataset contains information on tuberculosis (Tb) in both species, and on the parasite Elaphostrongylus cervi, which only infects red deer. In Zuur et al. (2009), Tb was modelled as a function of the continuous explanatory variable, length of the animal, denoted by LengthCT (CT is an abbreviation of cabeza-tronco, which is Spanish for head-body). Tb and Ecervi are shown as a vector of zeros and ones representing absence or presence of Tb and E. cervi larvae. Below, the first seven rows of the spreadsheet containing the deer data are given.

![a. Create the data set using functions you have learned so far.](images/clipboard-2404551342.png)

```{r}
data = data.frame(
  Farm = c('MO','MO','MO','MO','LN','SE','QM'),
  Month = c('11','07','07',NA,'09','09','11'),
  Year = c('00','00','01',NA,'03','03','02'),
  Sex = c(1,2,2,2,1,2,2),
  LengthClass = c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1),
  LengthCT = c(75,85,91.6,95,NA,105.5,106),
  Ecervi = c(0,0,0,NA,0,0,0),
  Tb = c(0,0,1,NA,0,0,0)
)
data
```

b\. Find the average length of the animals.

```{r}
mean(data$LengthCT, na.rm=T)
```

c\. Find the number of animals with sex 1 used in the study.

```{r}
nrow(data[data$Sex==1,])

#or

tb1=na.omit(data$Tb)
q4 = length(tb1[tb1==1])
q4
```

d\. How many animals have tuberculosis in both species?

```{r}
nrow(subset(data,subset=c(Tb==1)))
```

e\. Suppose you decide to square root the length of the animals. Add the results to your data.

```{r}
data %>% mutate(SQRT = sqrt(data$LengthCT))
```

f\. Find the mean absolute error (MAE) for the lengths of the animals.

```{r}
data2 = data %>% mutate(diff = abs(data$LengthCT-mean(data$LengthCT, na.rm=T)))
data2

mean(data2$diff, na.rm=T)
```

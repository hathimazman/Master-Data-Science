A -\> B, or B given A

1.  Support $P(A \cap B)$

2.  Confidence $P(B|A) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$

3.  Lift $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)*P(B)}$

**Apriori**

1.  Frequent Itemsets: These are sets of items that appear together in a
    transaction more frequently than a specified threshold (called
    support).
2.  Association Rules: These are rules of the form {A} â†’ {B}, where:
    -   A is an item or itemset (e.g., "Bread"),
    -   B is another item or itemset (e.g., "Butter").
    -   The rule suggests that if A is bought, Bis likely to be bought
        as well.

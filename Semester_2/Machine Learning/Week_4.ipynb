    "\n",
    "+ Common resampling methods: bootstraping and cross validation. \n",
    "+ Cross validation can be used to estimate the test error to evaluate model perfomance (**model assessment**) or to select appropriate level of flexibility (**model selection**).\n",
    "+ Boostraping provide a measure of accuracy of a parameter estimates or statistical learning method.\n",

    "## Cross Validation\n",
    "### Validation Set Approach\n",
    "+ Usually a test set is not available so a simple strategy to create one is to split the available data into training and testing (**validation or hold-out set**). \n",
    "+ Divide the data into half where the observation in each sets are randomly selected.\n",
    "+ To assess the model perfomance - quantitative responses usually use MSE, for categorical can use error rate, area under the curve, F1 score, weighting of confusion matrix, etc...\n",
    "+ Drawbacks of this technique: \n",
    "    + the validation estimation of the test error rate can be highly variable.\n",

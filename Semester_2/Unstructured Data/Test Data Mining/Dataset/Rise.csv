Rise

Sometimes in life you feel the fight is over
And it seems as though the writings on the wall
"Superstar, you finally made it"
But once your picture becomes tainted
It's what they call
The rise and fall

I always said that I was gonna make it
Now it's plain for everyone to see
But this game I'm in don't take no prisoners
Just casualties
I know that everything is gonna change
Even the friends I knew before may go
But this dream is the life I've been searching for
Started believing that I was the greatest
My life was never gonna be the same
'Cause with the money came a different status
That's when things change
Now I'm too concerned with all the things I own
Blinded by all the pretty girls I see
I'm beginning to lose my integrity

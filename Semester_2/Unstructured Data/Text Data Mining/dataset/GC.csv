"Gertrude Cox, The First Lady Of Statistics"
Gertrude Cox didn't intend to become a statistician. 
"After graduating from high school in 1918, she decided she wanted to be a deaconess in the Methodist Episcopal Church. "
"Thinking that some knowledge of psychology and craft could be useful in her chosen career, she enrolled at Iowa State University to study these subjects. "
"However, she chose to major in mathematics as that subject had come naturally to her in high school. "
"In order to pay her college expenses, she landed a job in the computing lab of her calculus professor, George Snedecor. "
"Encouraged by this experience, she went on to study statistics, receiving Iowa State's first Master's degree in statistics a couple of years later."
